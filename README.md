# Japanese Language

wargrey

I am a native Chinese who speaks Mandarin. I have been learning English
for more than 16 years, and now I am learning Japanese as the second
foreign language. Given that I am a software engineer and very
interested in Linguistics, regular language textbooks are hardly
satisfactory. So I embarked on this project to write my own textbook.

Since practicing Chinese is not so valuable for me, I therefore choose
English as the writing language. As a result, this book targets native
English speakers and anyone who are interested in English and Japanese.
Yes, as might be expected, comparing with Chinese is also something
interesting you will find.

**Microsoft Word** is good but not the best one for writing rigorous
books, one mentionable reason is that authors have to maintain
references on their own. **LaTex** is too cumbersome to work with
directly. **Racket Scribble** just fits the case.

Discussions and Suggestions are welcome.
