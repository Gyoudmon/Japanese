# Parts of Speech | 品詞

_Part of Speech_ is the category of words that have similar grammatical
properties. More precisely, Japanese words are categorized based on
their meanings, grammatical functions and inflections. Given that
Japanese is an agglutinative language in which case words are well
formed and keep consistent after their unions, Japanese words are well
categoried into 10 - 12 groups.

* _Independent Words_ 「自立語」

  * _Substantives_ 「体言」

    * Nouns 「名詞」

      * Pronouns 「代名詞」

      * Numerals 「数詞」

  * _Declinable Words_ 「用言」

    * Verbs 「動詞」

    * Adjectives 「形容詞」

    * Adjectival Verbs 「形容動詞」

  * _Modifiers_ 「修飾語」

    * Prenominals 「連体詞」

    * Adverbs 「副詞」

  * Conjunctions 「接続詞」

  * Interjections 「感動詞」

* _Ancillary Words_ 「付属語」

  * Particles 「助詞」

  * Auxiliary Verbs 「助動詞」

These categories are typically taught at school in Japan. However
categorization schemes may vary due to different grammatically
perspectives. Nowadays, textbooks tend to use modern categorization
scheme. For example, the Adjectives and Adjectival Verbs have been
merged, with being named as イ-adjective and ナ-adjective respectively.
These changes may not bad, despite the fact that new categories may be
given meaningless names, say カ変 conjugation verb and サ変 conjugation verb
are merged as _the Type-III verb_ which is an awful name This might be a
personal preference as what I have learnt from Software Engineering is
that do not use meaningless words (such as _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_) to name
variables since they make the code less readable for others and even
yourself in the future. Thus, this book follows the modern scheme but
drops all meaningless names.
