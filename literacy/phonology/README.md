# International Phonetic Alphabet | 国際音標文字こくさいおんぴょうもじ

The _International Phonetic Alphabet(IPA)_ is an alphabetic system of
phonetic notation based primarily on the Latin alphabet. It was devised
the International Phonetic Association \(also abbreviated to IPA\) and
has become the standardized representation of speech sounds for all
(spoken) languages since 19th century.

The IPA provides notations for both phone and phoneme. By convention,
phones and phonemes are represented in \[ \] and / /, respectively.

_Vowel_s are produced with an open vocal tract, which means the airflow
will not be disturbed from vocal cords to lips to outside, and vary in
quality, loudness, and length.
