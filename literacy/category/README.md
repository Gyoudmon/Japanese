# Case | 格かく

A _case_ is any of the forms of a noun, adjective, or pronoun that
express the semantic relation of a word to other words, especially to
verbs, in a phrase, clause, or sentence. Given that Japanese is an
agglutinative language with a rigid SOV topological structure, cases
therefore play a prominent role in marking grammatical structure as well
as information structure and thematic role.

In the sense of the case category, the standard modern Japanese has been
categorized as an _nominative-accusative language_ 「対格言語たいかくげんご」 in
which case the subject of the transitive verb and the intransitive verb
share the same case, but are distinguished from the case of object of
the transitive verbs.

Japanese implements its case system by postpositional particles which
more precisely are also known as case particles. These case particles
are phonologically bound to the preceding words as the form
`「Substantive + Case Particle」` is, nevertheless, case particles are
actually phrasal clitics rather than nominal declensions so that other
elements (e.g. adverbial particles) may intervene between case particles
and the marking substantives or extend the scope over more than one noun
phrase`ex1.1`.

`Example 1.1`                                       
太郎たろうと花子はなこだけが`NOM`駅えきから`ABL`歩いあるた`PST`。            
                                                    
 Only Taro and Hanako walked from the train station.

One of the key features of Japanese case system is based on its
topic-prominent nature. Multiple nominative-marked noun phrases may
occure within one clause so that the initial one may be considered as
being characterized by the remaining part of the clause`ex1.2`. This
phenomenon has become a major problem for describing Japanese case
system.

`Example 1.2`                                       
太郎たろうが`NOM`母親ははおやが`NOM`評判ひょうばんが`NOM`良いい。            
                                                    
 Taro is such that his mother has a good reputation.

## 1. Surface Cases | 表層格ひょうそうかく

Cases are language-specific entityHaspelmath \[2:ToC\] which means case
labels are only valid for particular languages. For convenience, similar
case labels are used for different languages, nonetheless, it is still
senseless to compare cases that share same names among languages.
Besides, linguists with different backgrounds use same terms for
different concepts, or use different terms for very similar or identical
concepts. This issue is even majorer in the case category.

As agglutinative language tends to have a bigger case system, there are
11 primary cases marked by 10 case particles in the standard modern
Japanese.

### 1.1. Nominative | 主格しゅかく 「~が」

The _nominative_ usually functions as the subject of a verb or a
predicate, and be marked by the case particle が`ex1.3`. Despite the fact
that は-marked topic may also be interpreted as the subject, the
mainstream suggests that Japanese subject refers to the logical subject
instead of the topic`ex1.3d`.

`Example 1.3`                      
 `a` 雨あめが`NOM`降りふ出しでた`PST`。        
                                   
      It started to rain           
 `b` 風かぜが`NOM`涼すずしい。               
                                   
      The wind is cool.            
 `c` 誰だれが`NOM`幹事かんじです`COP`か`SFP`。  
                                   
      Who is the secretary?        
 `d` 魚さかなは`TOP`、猫ねこが`NOM`食べたた`PST`。
                                   
      The cat ate the fish.        

What is triky here is that が-marked nominatives may have no
corresponding grammatical function. が marks subject arguments as well as
non-subject arguments`ex1.4`, especially for multiple nominative-marked
clauses where the initial nominative is considered as the subject but
the rest may just be left undefined in the sense of grammar`ex1.2`.

`Example 1.4`                                                   
 `a` 私わたしは`TOP`数学すうがくが`NOM`大好きだいすだ`COP`。                        
                                                                
      I love mathematics. \[emotion\]                           
 `b` いま、冷つめたいビールが`NOM`飲みのたい`Wish`なあ`SFP`。                       
                                                                
      At the moment, (I) want to drink a cold beer. \[wish\]    
 `c` 太郎たろうが`NOM`この本ほんが`NOM`読ようみ易やすい/難にくい。                       
                                                                
      For Taro to read this book is easy/difficult. \[feelings\]
 `d` 田中たなかは`TOP`英語えいごが`NOM`分かりわます`POL`。                         
                                                                
      Tanaka can understand English. \[ability\]                

Those nominatives in `ex1.4` are typically considered as the
_target_ 「対象語たいしょうご」, which is a subtype of the object or complement,
usually being the target of emotion, feeling, wishes or ability.

`Example 1.5`                               
象ぞうは`TOP`、鼻はなが`NOM`長ながい。                    
                                            
 Speaking of the elephant, its nose is long.

Note the difference between `ex1.3d` and `ex1.5` both of which start
with a topic. The topic of the former actually acts as an object placed
before the subject, whereas the topic of the latter refers to the whole
that containing the part referred by the nominative and characterized by
its predicate. It’s still not clear whether the nominative in `ex1.5`
should be analyzed as the subject.

For more uses of nominative, see Valence | 結合価けつごうか. For more about
subject and topic, see \[missing\].

### 1.2. Accusative | 対格たいかく 「~を」

The _accusative_ functions as the direct object of a transitive
verb`ex1.6a`, or the complement of an intransitive verb, and be marked
by the case particle を.

`Example 1.6`                                             
 `a` 今いまの`GEN`若者わかものは`TOP`みんなスマホを`ACC`使いつかます`POL`。        
                                                          
      All young people today use smartphones.             
 `b` 18歳さいの`GEN`とき、故郷こきょうを`ACC`/から`ABL`離れはなました`POL`.`PST`。
                                                          
      At the age of 18, (I) left my hometown.             
 `c` 鳶とびが`NOM`紺碧こんぺきの`GEN`空そらを`ACC`飛びとました`POL`.`PST`。     
                                                          
      A black kite flew over the cerulean blue sky.       

More precisely, を-marked complements identify the source`ex1.6b` or
path`ex1.6c` arguments of motion verbs. For path arguments, they can
only be marked by the accusative particle; while for source arguments,
they can also be marked by the ablative particle, but note that not all
source arguments can be marked by the accusative particle`ex1.7`. That
is, accusatives only work with animate subjects that are volitional.

`Example 1.7`                 
血ちが`NOM`傷口きずぐちから`ABL`出でた`PST`。
                              
 Blood went out of the wound. 

### 1.3. Genitive | 属格ぞっかく 「~の」

The _genitive_ relates the possessor substantive to the head
substantive, or indicates the appositive of another substantive that
sharing the same referent, and typically be marked by the particle のIt
has been a standard practice to treat の as a case particle. 並立助詞へいりつじょし
or 連体助詞れんたいじょし might be more appropriate..

The possession has a much broader interpretation than ownership.
Property, material, quantity, time, place, etc. All these asymmetric
relationships are counted on. So that のs may not appear exactly in the
translated sentences.

`Example 1.8`                                                    
 `a` 今日きょうの`GEN`テレビ東京とうきょうの`GEN`『TXNニュース』の`GEN`番組ばんぐみは`TOP`つまらない。
                                                                 
      Today's "TXN News" programs of TV Tokyo are boring.        
 `b` ドイツの`GEN`スチールの`GEN`包丁ほうちょうが`NOM`欲しいほです`COP`.`POL`。          
                                                                 
      \(I\) want a steel kitchen knife made in Germany.          
 `c` 14000円えんの`GEN`日本語にほんごの`GEN`本ほんを`ACC`買いかました`PST`。            
                                                                 
      \(I\) bought a book of Japanese for ¥14000.                

Genitives are the source of ambiguities when they are linked
together`ex1.9` as the form `「SubstantiveのSubstantive」` also identifies
a substantive. Usually the genitive chain is interpreted from left to
right, but this convention seems not to be guaranteed by any rules.

`Example 1.9`                                     
私わたしの`GEN`彼女かのじょの`GEN`学校がっこうの`GEN`学生がくせい          
                                                  
 the student in the same school as my girlfriend's
 the student in the school owned by my girlfriend 

Nonetheless, the appositive is only allowed to be followed by a
substantive that does not contain another genitive`ex1.10a`, and to do a
exhaustive enumerating, the sentence has to be constructed in another
way`ex1.10b`.

`Example 1.10`                                                                               
 `a` こちらは`TOP`私わたしの`GEN`彼女かのじょの`GEN`高橋たかはしさんです`COP`.`POL`。                                   
                                                                                             
      This is my girlfriend, Takahashi.                                                      
 `b` こちらは`TOP`私わたしの`GEN`彼女かのじょで`CONJ`、日本人にほんじんで`CONJ`、芸術家げいじゅつかで`CONJ`、高橋たかはしさんです`COP`.`POL`。
                                                                                             
      This is my girlfriend, Takahashi, who is a Japanese artist.                            

Revisiting `ex1.5`. What has already been learnt is that the topic
refers to the whole that containing the part referred by the nominative,
it is a good chance to transform that complex sentence, whose predicate
is also a subject-predicate clause, into a simple one with
genitive`ex1.11`.

`Example 1.11`                     
 `a` 象は`TOP`、鼻が`NOM`長い。            
                                   
 `b` 象ぞうの`GEN`鼻はなが`NOM`長ながい。       
                                   
      The nose of elephant is long.

Historically speaking, the particle の is a marker of adnominal
modification, and turns the word or phrase it attached into an
attributive modifier`ex1.12`. But it remains to be seen whether the use
of の as possessive marker should be analyzed as a subtype of adnominal
modification marker.

`Example 1.12`

      Taro found a way to the shrine. \[postpositional phrase(allative) + の\]

      The souvenir for parents is a set of tea utensils. \[postpositional    
     phrase(dative) + の\]                                                    

Case instances are regualr seen as the postpositional phrase attached by
の. What irregular here is that there are no such formatives like `「がの」`,
`「をの」`, and `「にの」`, where the first two turn into just `「の」`s and the
third one turns into `「への」ex1.12c`.

Further more, の may also function as a nominalizer`ex1.13a` or a
pro-form that refers back to an entity that is recoverable from the
discourse context`ex1.13b`. In these situations, the の and the marking
word or phrase as a whole becomes a substantive, and no other
substantive is following it.

`Example 1.13`

      Taro stopped going out alone.                                    
 `b` どんな鞄かばんが`NOM`良いですかい。丈夫じょうぶの`One`を`ACC`ください`Wish`。                 
                                                                       
      What kind of bag do you want? (I'd like) the durable one, please.

Anyway, in both English and Mandarin Chinese, a noun can be modified by
another noun directly, whereas Japanese does so with genitives. As
mentioned in William Strunk Jr. and White \[3:Hyphen\], two words tend
to be combined as a union, which eventually becomes a new word, usually
after a period of hyphenation. To illustrate: `wild life` ⇒ `wild-life`
⇒ `wildlife`. It is reasonable to consider Japanese compound nouns the
same way, as this pattern has already been seen not rarely, such as
`wild animal 「野生動物やせいどうぶつ」`, `math book 「数学本すうがくほん」`. As expected, some
cases may collide with existing words, or change meanings and/or spells,
including `girl 「女おんなの子こ」` and `woman/girl 「女子じょし」`.

### 1.4. Dative | 与格よかく 「~に」

The _dative_ usually functions as the indirect object of a ditransitive
verb, and be marked by the case particle にFrom now on, things become
disorder as uses of dative overlap uses of many other case particles, it
is reasonable to consider this phenomenon from the perspective of the
case hierarchy introduced in Blake \[1:TCH\]. For short, dative is the
last core case after nominative, accusative, and genitive, later on more
cases are defined to make expressions more detailed.. The word dative
itself is derived from the Latin ​_「`(case) of giving`」_​, which
semantics can be phrased as `「give B to A」ex1.14a` or `「make (B) for
A」ex1.14b`, where `「A」` is the indirect object, someone or something,
should be marked by に.

`Example 1.14`                                                                                   
 `a` 七夕たなばた、鵲かささぎが`NOM`牽牛けんぎゅうと織女おりめに`DAT`会うあ機会きかいを`ACC`与あたえます`POL`。                             
                                                                                                 
      At the Star Festival, Magpies give a chance to Altair and Vega to meet.                    
     \[recipient\]                                                                               
 `b` 7月7日しちがつなのか、鵲かささぎが`NOM`彦星ひこぼしと織姫おりひめ\(の`GEN`会合かいごう)に`DAT`鵲橋じゃっきょうを`ACC`作つくってあげ`Give`ます`POL`。
                                                                                                 
      On July 7th, Magpies make a bridge for (the meeting of) Altair and                         
     Vega. \[benefactive\]                                                                       

For pattern A as exemplified in `ex1.14a`, the indirect object follows
the preposition `「to」`, which also be used to identify the destination
of motion verbs or purpose coincidentally. Thus, in some languages
influenced by English, directly or indirectly, use of dative overlaps
use of allative`ex1.15`.

`Example 1.15`                                                           
 `a` 昨日きのうの`GEN`午後ごご、図書館としょかんに`DAT`行きいませんでした`POL`.`NEG`.`PST`。           
                                                                         
      \(I\) didn't go to the library yesterday afternoon. \[destination\]
 `b` 学校がっこうに`DAT`授業じゅぎょうを`ACC`受けうに`DAT`行きいます`POL`。                       
                                                                         
      \(I\) go to school to take classes. \[destination\]\[purpose\]     
 `c` 学校がっこうに`DAT`授業じゅぎょうに`DAT`行きいます`POL`。                                
                                                                         
      \(I\) go to school to teach. \[destination\]\[purpose\]            

When the purpose argument is provided, it must precede the motion verb
immediately, and its に-marking word is the continuative form of a
verb`ex1.15b` or a verbal noun`ex1.15c`. Note that the continuative form
of the verbalized verbal noun should be し-suffixed, but if so the
sentence would sound like an oriental curse: `go to die 「死しに行いく」`. Thus,
verbal nouns tend to be used directly instead, though the し-suffixed
versions work as well.

For pattern B as exemplified in `ex1.14b`, it can be semantically
extended to express the existence of `「B」` in place `「A」`. This
use`ex1.16` overlaps the use of locative.

`Example 1.16`

 There are high walls made around the country.                     
 \(Someone\) made high walls around the country. \[ambiguity\]     
 \(Someone\) made high walls and installed them around the country.
\[verbose\]                                                        

Literally translating, the resulting sentence would be the second one,
which is actually ambiguity and yet indistinguishable from `ex1.19`.
What really should be concerned here is the existence of the entity
eventually made by the action rather than the action itself producing
the entity, so both the first and third ones are accurate despite the
verboseness of the third one.

Particularly, there are two shortcuts to express existence, one is いる
for animate entities`ex1.17a`, the other is ある for ianimate
entities`ex1.17b`.

`Example 1.17`

By far, the dative has been adapted to a wide range of uses in addition
to those two basic patterns. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to only
mention distinct uses here`ex1.18`, and some reorganization might be
performed.

      Taro made a suggestion for Hanako to read a book.

### 1.5. Locative | 処格しょかく 「~で」「~に」

The _locative_ specifies a location where events or actions take place,
and be marked by the case particle で or に. Be careful, the term locative
is a little tricky. As _spatial relation_s can be grouped into 4
directional classes: location `「at」`, goal `「to, toward」`, source
`「from」`, and path `「along, through」`. In a broad sense, each of these
four classes is associated with a place as its location, but the
locative identified location only stands for the first class.

So that the overlap among uses of dative and locative is all around the
semantics of existence. に indicates the location where someone or
something exists in which case the way to arrive or to be made is
trivial`ex1.16`, whereas で indicates the location that some events or
actions occur in which case the side effects of the events or actions
are trivail`ex1.19`.

`Example 1.19`                                                          
国くにの`GEN`周りまわで`LOC`高たかい城壁じょうへきを`ACC`作っつくた`PST`。                         
                                                                        
 \(Someone\) made high walls around the country \(how about those walls?
who cares\).                                                            

Despite the fact that locative is actually where で started as a case
particle, now で has been considered as the instrumental, and the
location has been categorized as an instrument. Based on this fact,
で-marked locative can be better explained: the location as an instrument
provides some particular functions that benefit the event or action,
independent of the goal, and eventually be chosen by the agents.

Take it easy, and don’t hang on these explainations. で and に as the
locative marker are virtually interchangeable since additional
information can be inferred from contexts.

By the way, some substantives marked by で may look like locations, but
they actually represent ranges or collections`ex1.20`.

`Example 1.20`                                                  
ここは`TOP`日本にほんで`INSTR`も有名ゆうめいです`COP`.`POL`よ`SFP`。                
                                                                
 \(Let me tell you,\) this is a famous place all over the Japan.

### 1.6. Allative | 向格こうかく 「~へ」「~に」

The _allative_ specifies the goal of a motion verb and stands for the
second class of the spatial relation, and typically be marked by the
case particle へ or に`ex1.21`.

`Example 1.21`                                              
 `a` 今度こんどいつヨーロッパへ`ALL`行きいます`POL`か`SFP`。                    
                                                            
      When (will you) go to Europe next time?               
 `b` ご飯はんの`GEN`後あと、公園こうえんへ`ALL`散歩さんぽに`DAT`行きいました`POL`.`PST`。
                                                            
      After dinner, (I) went for a walk to the park.        

Similar to で and に as the locative marker, へ and に as the allative
marker are also virtually interchangeable. へ tends to be used when the
direction is more emphasized, whereas に pays more attention to the
destination or purpose`ex1.21b`.

`Example 1.22`                                     
中国ちゅうごくの`GEN`方かたは`TOP`こちらへ`ALL`どうぞ`POL`。           
                                                   
 For Chinese, (if you would) come this way, please.

Besides, に-marked allative can stand alone without an explicit
action`ex1.22`, especially when combined with の to form an adnominal
modifier`ex1.12c`.

### 1.7. Instrumental | 具格ごかく 「~で」

_instrumental_

### 1.8. Ablative | 奪格だっかく 「~から」

_ablative_

### 1.9. Terminative | 到格とうかく 「~まで」

_terminative_

### 1.10. Comitative | 共格きょうかく 「~と」

The _comitative_ encodes the relationship of accompaniment between two
participants in an event, and be marked by the case particle と`ex1.23`.
Both of the participants are agents of the action, this is the key point
for distinguishing between the comitative and the instrumental.

`Example 1.23`                                
 `a` 湯本さんゆもとと`COM`一緒いっしょにデパートに`DAT`行きいます`POL`。
                                              
      \(I\) will go shopping with Mr. Yumoto. 
 `b` 私わたしは`TOP`兄あにと`COM`喧嘩するけんか。              
                                              
      I quarrel with my brother all the time. 

The adverb 一緒に is often used together if one of the participants is
already adequate to the event or action`ex1.23a`.

`Example 1.24`                                         
 `a` 私わたしと`PTCL`姉あねは`TOP`犬猿けんえんの`GEN`仲なかだ`COP`。        
                                                       
      My sister and I lead a cat-and-dog life.         
      My sister and I quarrel (violently) all the time.
 `b` 猫ねこと`PTCL`犬いぬ、どっちが`NOM`好きすです`COP`.`POL`か`SFP`。    
                                                       
      Cats or dogs, which one do you like?             

Like の, と can also be used as a parallel particle to combine
substantives, in which case the compound substantive does not introduce
new sentence component`ex1.24a`, whereas と-marked comitative functions
as the complement`ex1.23b` of the action. Nonetheless, such a subtle
difference usually does not make sense.

と as a parallel particle implies the exhaustive emueration. That is, all
substantives in the mentioned collection must be combined one by one
explicitly`ex1.25a`. For non-exhaustive enumeration, alternatives are
available, such as combining the parallel particle や `「and, or」` and the
adverbial particle など `「etc.」ex1.25b`.

`Example 1.25`                                                                           
 `a` 私わたしたちは`TOP`田中たなかさんと`PTCL`中村なかむらさんと`PTCL`花子はなこさんと`PTCL`由紀子ゆきこに`DAT`お礼れいを`ACC`お言いたいい。

     Yukiko.                                                                             
 `b` 駅えきの`GEN`周辺しゅうへんは`TOP`居酒屋いざかやや`PTCL`喫茶店きっさてんや`PTCL`果物屋くだものやなど`PTCL`が`NOM`あります`POL`。 
                                                                                         
      There are bar, café, fruit store, and the like around the railway                  
     station.                                                                            
      There are many shops around the railway station, such as bar, café and             
     fruit store.                                                                        

Note that や and など combination is not a set collocation. That is, both
of them can be used without the other as long as their literal meanings
are appropreciate and not redundant.

Another alternative is the parallel particle とか which sounds more
colloquial than や. とか should mark all enumerated items including the
last one`ex1.26`.

`Example 1.26`                                                                              
休やすみの`GEN`日ひは`TOP`テレビを`ACC`見るみとか`PTCL`、買かい物ものを`ACC`するとか`PTCL`、猫ねこと`COM`遊あそぶとか`PTCL`します`POL`。
                                                                                            
 On my days off, I watch TV, shop or play with cat.                                         

As one can see, the enumerated items are not restricted to substantives,
the stem-form verbs, adjectives, and quotations are also acceptable.

For more uses of と, see \[missing\].

### 1.11. Comparative | 比較格ひかくかく 「~より」

The _comparative_ specifies the standard of comparison of inequality,
and be marked by the case particle より`ex1.27`. Since the comparative can
be considered as a special case of ablative, and より do have some
overlapping uses with から, some grammer books may merge these two cases.

`Example 1.27`                                   
花子はなこが`NOM`太郎たろうより`CMP`その仕事しごとに`DAT`適任てきにんだ`COP`。
                                                 
 Hanako is more qualified for the job than Taro. 

Both similative and superlative are unavailable in Japanese,
nonetheless, these two semantics can be expressed easily with or without
comparative`ex1.28`.

`Example 1.28`                                                                        
 `a` 彼女かのじょは`TOP`私わたしと`COM`同おなじくらい速はやく泳およげる。                                          
                                                                                      
      She can swim as fast as I (can). \[similative\]                                 
 `b` 彼かれは`TOP`どの生徒よりせいとも`CMP`足があし速`NOM`いはや。                                           
                                                                                      
      He runs faster than any other students. \[superlative\]                         
 `c` 彼かれは`TOP`彼女かのじょが`NOM`それまでに`DAT`出会であった中じゅうで`INSTR`一番いちばん厳きびしい先生せんせいだった`COP`.`PST`。
                                                                                      
      He was the strictest teacher she had ever met. \[superlative\]
