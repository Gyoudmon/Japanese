# Case | 格

_Case_ is any of the forms of a noun, adjective, or pronoun that express
the semantic relation of a word to other words, especially to verbs, in
a sentence.

In the sense of case, the standard modern Japanese has been categorized
as an _accusative language_ 「対格言語」 which means subjects of transitive
verbs and intransitive verbs share the same cases, but are distinguished
from cases of objects of transitive verbs.

Japanese implements its case system by postpositional particles, which
traditionally are also known as _case particles_ 「格助詞」. These case
particles are phonologically bound to the preceding words as the form
_noun + case particle_ is, nevertheless, the case particles are phrasal
clitics rather than nominal declensions so that other elements may
intervene between the case particles and the marking nouns or extend the
scope over more than one noun phrases.
