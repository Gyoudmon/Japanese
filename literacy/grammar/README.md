# Case | 格

_Case_ is any of the forms of a noun, adjective, or pronoun that express
the semantic relation of a word to other words, especially to verbs, in
a sentence.

In the sense of case, the standard modern Japanese has been categorized
as an _accusative language_ 「対格言語」 which means subjects of transitive
verbs and intransitive verbs share the same cases, but are distinguished
from cases of objects of transitive verbs.

Japanese implements its case system by postpositional particles, which
traditionally are also known as case particles. These case particles are
phonologically bound to the preceding words as the form `noun + case
particle` is, nevertheless, case particles are actually phrasal clitics
rather than nominal declensions so that other elements may intervene
between case particles and the marking nouns or extend the scope over
more than one noun phrasesex1.1.

                                                      
`Example 1.1`                                         
太郎と花子だけが駅から歩いた.                                       
                                                      
` Only Taro and Hanako walked from the train station.`
                                                      

One of the key features of Japanese case system is based on its
topic-prominent propertyKorean and Mandarin Chinese are also
topic-prominent languages. Multiple nominative-marked noun phrases may
occure within one clause so that the initial one may be considered as
the topic and described by the remaining part of the clauseex1.2.

                                                      
`Example 1.2`                                         
太郎が母親が評判が良い.                                          
                                                      
` Taro is such that his mother has a good reputation.`
