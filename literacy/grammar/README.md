# Case | 格

_Case_ is any of the forms of a `noun`, `adjective`, or `pronoun` that
express the semantic relation of a word to other words, especially to
`verbs`, in a sentence.

In the sense of `case`, the standard modern Japanese has been
categorized as an _accusative language_ 「対格言語」 which means subjects of
`transitive verbs` and `intransitive verbs` share the same `cases`, but
are distinguished from `cases` of objects of `transitive verbs`.

Japanese implements its `case` system by postpositional `particles`,
which traditionally are also known as `case particles`. These `case
particles` are phonologically bound to the preceding words as the form
`substantives + case particle` is, nevertheless, `case particles` are
actually phrasal clitics rather than nominal declensions so that other
elements may intervene between `case particles` and the marking
`substantives` or extend the scope over more than one noun
phrases`ex1.1`.

`Example 1.1`                                       
太郎と花子だけが駅から歩いた.                                     
                                                    
 Only Taro and Hanako walked from the train station.

One of the key features of Japanese `case` system is based on its
`topic`-prominent propertyKorean and Mandarin Chinese are also
topic-prominent languages. Multiple nominative-marked noun phrases may
occure within one clause so that the initial one may be considered as
the `topic` and described by the remaining part of the clause`ex1.2`.

`Example 1.2`                                       
太郎が母親が評判が良い.                                        
                                                    
 Taro is such that his mother has a good reputation.

Just as the `case particles`, there are 10 prominent `cases` in the
standard modern Japanese, but they are not one-to-one corresponding.
