# Case | 格かく

_Case_ is any of the forms of a noun, adjective, or pronoun that express
the semantic relation of a word to other words, especially to verbs, in
a sentence.

In the sense of case, the standard modern Japanese has been categorized
as an _accusative language_ 「対格言語たいかくげんご」 which means subjects of
transitive verbs and intransitive verbs share the same cases, but are
distinguished from cases of objects of transitive verbs.

Japanese implements its case system by postpositional particles, which
traditionally are also known as case particles. These case particles are
phonologically bound to the preceding words, nevertheless, case
particles are actually phrasal clitics rather than nominal declensions
so that other elements may intervene between case particles and the
marking substantives or extend the scope over more than one noun
phrases`ex1.1`.

`Example 1.1`                                       
太郎たろうと花子はなこだけが`NOM`駅えきから`ABL`歩いあるた`PST`.            
                                                    
 Only Taro and Hanako walked from the train station.

One of the key features of Japanese case system is based on its
topic-prominent propertyKorean and Mandarin Chinese are also
topic-prominent languages. Multiple nominative-marked noun phrases may
occure within one clause so that the initial one may be considered as
the topic and described by the remaining part of the clause`ex1.2`.

`Example 1.2`                                       
太郎たろうが`NOM`母親ははおやが`NOM`評判ひょうばんが`NOM`良いい.            
                                                    
 Taro is such that his mother has a good reputation.

There are 10 prominent case particles in the standard modern Japanese:
が, を, に, の, へ, で, より, から, まで, and と.

Just as the case particles, there are 10 prominent cases in the standard
modern Japanese, but they are not one-to-one corresponding.
