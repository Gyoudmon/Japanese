# Case | 格

_Case_ is any of the forms of a noun, adjective, or pronoun that express
the semantic relation of a word to other words, especially to verbs, in
a sentence.

In the sense of case, the standard modern Japanese has been categorized
as an _accusative language_ 「対格言語」 which means the subjects of
transitive verbs and intransitive verbs share the same cases, but are
distinguished from cases of objects of transitive verbs.

Japanese implements its case system by postpositional particles, which
traditionally are also known as _case particles_ 「格助詞」. These case
particles are phonologically bound to the preceding words as the form
_noun + case particle_ is.
